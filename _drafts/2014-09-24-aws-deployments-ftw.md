"The cloud" has become almost a synonym for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Just like Snap is hosted on AWS, a lot of user users prefer to host their applications on AWS.

Starting today, we would like to announce improved integration with AWS. We now let our users quickly and easily deploy to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [OpsWorks](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) and [ElasticBeanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) at the click of a button.

All AWS deployments are just a 4 step process:

* Select a stage type
* Choose the deployment type
* Enter your credentials
* Tweak the command to your deployment

AWS deployments paired with our deployment history feature tells you exactly what has been deployed, by whom and what is pending deployments.
