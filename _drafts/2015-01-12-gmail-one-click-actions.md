For those of you who are Gmail users and recieve Snap notifications via email, we have added links to builds and pull-requests on the subject lines.

![](/assets/images/screenshots/gmail-one-click-actions/gmail-screenshot.png){: .screenshot .big}

You can now use these links to get access to your builds quicker, without having to open the notification emails.

If you'd like to build this feature for your applications, checkout [Gmail's Actions in the Inbox](https://developers.google.com/gmail/actions/).
