Snap's product owner [Badri Janakiraman](https://github.com/badrij) and developer [Akshay Karle](https://github.com/akshaykarle) were at the [Pipelines annual conference](http://web.pipelineconf.info/) last month, talking about why continuous delivery should be a journey, not a destination. Although it certainly would be easier if one could just do step 1, step 2, etc, and achieve continuous delivery, it's more complex than that and really should be a set of principles that informs tool choices, systems architecture, and development practices. Here are a few key points from the talk:

-- Start with getting working software into hands of users 

-- Don’t be afraid of “re-design”/”re-work” 

-- Layer on qualities of reliability, automation, frequent releases, etc.

-- Kick the can down the road.
