> Snap now has improved support for Scala. `sbt` is available as a binary on the build machine. You can start using sbt on Snap without having to create an sbt executable in your source repository. You may rad more about it on our [documentation site](http://docs.snap-ci.com/the-ci-environment/languages/scala/).

Typically, we do not claim to offer first class support for a language/framework on Snap unless we provide some basic heuristics to help users set up their builds. Based on this defintion, Snap currently supports Ruby, Rails & Java builds. However, Snap can run builds for any JVM based language. In this post, I will talk about how to set up a build for simple Scala/Play project.

If you have your own project on GitHub you can use that. You would need to add sbt-laucher to your project if not present and a script to invoke it. This might look something like
{% highlight bash %}
>> curl -LO http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch//0.12.4/sbt-launch.jar
>> echo 'java -Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=384M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"' > sbt
>> chmod u+x sbt
{% endhighlight %}

For those you don't have a scala/play project you can follow the following instructions.

##NB: Tricking Snap into believing you are running a Java project
Since Scala is not yet a language which has first class support- by our original definition, you can trick Snap into thinking that it is working with a Java project by adding an empty pom.xml or build.xml file to your project root. Now, with the tricking behind us, we can proceed to run our sbt build as follows.


##Project Set Up.

You can find the instructions to setup a Play Todolist project [here](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/ScalaTodoList). After you have successfully created the project, you need to add sbt-launcher(v0.12.4) to the root of the project project.

{% highlight bash %}
>> cd ~/projects/todolist
(todolist) >> curl -LO http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch/0.12.4/sbt-launch.jar
{% endhighlight %}

Create script to invoke sbt-laucher in PROJECT_ROOT.

{% highlight bash %}
(todolist) >> echo 'java -Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=384M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"' > sbt
(todolist) >> chmod u+x sbt
{% endhighlight %}

Run test on local machine.

{% highlight bash %}
(todolist) >> ./sbt clean test
{% endhighlight %}

##Add the project to github

Create a [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo) on Github named todolist and push local todolist repository to github

{% highlight bash %}
(todolist) >> git init .
(todolist) >> git add .
(todolist) >> git commit -m "first commit"
(todolist) >> git remote add origin git@github.com:<<your_github_id>>/todolist.git
(todolist) >> git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

##Setup build for todolist project on [Snap](https://snap-ci.com/)

Login to Snap and add "todolist" project. Snap will try to detect the framework and fail, you would see a warning stating "Manually Configure a project"

Click "+ADD NEW". And select "Custom Stage" (Ignore the Ruby version drop down ;))

Enter "Build" in "STAGE NAME" and "./sbt clean test" in "Tasks to be executed".

Click "Create Project"

That’s all there is to it. Snap will now monitor your repository and run builds for all commits. Snap has a lot more to offer from CCTray, HipChat and Campfire build notifications to manual gated deployments to production environments. Also, we’re just getting warmed up.
