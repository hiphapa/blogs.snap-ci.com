We have all had times when the build "works on my machine" but "is read on the build machine". Having your build running on a managed environment, makes it even harder, because you have to keep making tweaks in order to understand what's going on.

Starting today, Snap offers you the ability to diagnose a build, and making it a lot more straightforward.

If you're having issues with your build - just type `snap-shell` as a command in your pipeline configuration. When the command prompt is ready you'll see an icon on the build history page, you can now visit the logs page where you can start diagnosing.

Here's a quick video to demonstrate this feature:
