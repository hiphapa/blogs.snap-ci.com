Everybody loves faster feedback on their builds, including us. Starting today, we would now like to announce to you the ability to run your build across multiple "workers".

For users on the trial plan, small team plan and small business plans - you will now have the ability to run the same stage on multiple workers.

In order to assist with making your tests go faster, we have provided a [ruby gem](https://github.com/snap-ci/parallel-tests) that will automatically partition your tests based on the number of tests you have, and the number of workers you are running your builds with.

If you are not running a ruby project, don't worry, we provide a quick howto on how you can go about quickly [splitting your test suite]({{ site.link.docs }}speeding-up-builds/test-parallelism/).

As always, we would love to hear if you have any comments or tips to make your builds even better. Leave your comments below or [contact us]({{ site.link.contact_us }}) if you have any questions.
